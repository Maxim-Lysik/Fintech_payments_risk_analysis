# Fintech_payments_risk_analysis
📌 Overview

This project focuses on credit card default prediction in a fintech context.
It demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling — using public data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

🎯 Objective

The goal is to improve credit risk assessment by identifying customers with a high probability of default, helping financial institutions reduce losses and optimize risk management.
